GrowingSpiral
=============
This program draws a growing spiral. At a certain time, the spiral will grow one more edge. The user can move the mousewheel up or down to increase or decrease the speed of the growth. After the spiral grows to 10 rings, it resets and starts over.

As of now, there are no exceptions to handle the erros.
